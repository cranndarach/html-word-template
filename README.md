# HTML Word Template

A template to format HTML to look like the text was written in a word processor.

### Why it's cool:

* Save default styles via stylesheets
    * Especially helpful for accessibility control: e.g., if your eyes are sensitive to bright-white pages
    * Also allows you to change the interface background, which is not an option on all word processors
    * Save different stylesheets for different publication style (e.g., APA, MLA)
* Write the text in the editor of your choice, and worry about program-specific compatibility later
    * Avoid the bulkiness of word processors
    * Set up your environment how you want it
* Guidelines to tell you where to break up the text into a new page
* When writing in HTML, **you can comment out any parts you're hesitant about**, hiding them from the document preview without having to delete them altogether
* Speaking of comments, you can add revision-style comments with the `<comment></comment>` wrapper (for the text you're commenting on) and the `<ctext></ctext>` wrapper for the comment itself
* Keeping track of changes is much easier for HTML files than for word-processed files

## Future Goals

It is feature-light right now, because I made it so that I could write a fellowship application...which I should probably be writing.

But, soon I will post some documentation---probably a gh-pages site---so that you can use it even if you're unfamiliar with HTML or CSS.
