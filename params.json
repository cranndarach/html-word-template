  "body": "# HTML Word Template\r\n\r\nWrite in HTML, view it like a word-processed document.\r\n\r\n### Check it out:\r\n\r\n[This HTML file](https://github.com/cranndarach/html-word-template/blob/master/sample.html) with [this stylesheet](https://github.com/cranndarach/html-word-template/blob/master/css/stylesheet.css) look like [this](https://cranndarach.github.io/html-word-template/sample.html) in a browser.\r\n\r\n## Why it's cool:\r\n\r\n* Save default styles via stylesheets\r\n    * Especially helpful for accessibility control: e.g., if your eyes are sensitive to bright-white pages\r\n    * Also allows you to change the interface background (e.g., \"theater mode\"), which is not an option on all word processors\r\n    * Save different stylesheets for different publication styles (e.g., APA, MLA) instead of looking up the header hierarchy every time\r\n* Portable: Write the text in the editor of your choice without worrying if it will hold up on a different system\r\n    * Avoid the bulkiness of word processors\r\n    * Set up your environment how you want it\r\n* Guidelines to tell you where to break up the text into a new page\r\n* When writing in HTML, **you can comment out any parts you're hesitant about**, hiding them from the document preview without having to delete them altogether\r\n* Speaking of comments, you can add revision-style comments with the `<comment></comment>` wrapper (for the text you're commenting on) and the `<ctext></ctext>` wrapper for the comment itself\r\n* Version control systems actually like HTML files: keep track of the changes you've made on manuscripts, etc.\r\n\r\n## How to use it\r\n\r\n### If you're familiar with HTML and CSS:\r\n\r\n**First**, obtain the relevant files\r\n\r\n**Option 1:** Clone the repository\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/cranndarach/html-word-template.git`\r\n\r\n**Option 2:** Download just what you need\r\n\r\n* Hop over to the [repository](https://github.com/cranndarach/html-word-template)\r\n* Download either [`sample.html`](https://github.com/cranndarach/html-word-template/blob/master/sample.html) (which has sample text in case you like visual examples) or [`template.html`](https://github.com/cranndarach/html-word-template/blob/master/template.html) (which has the important tags and comments, but is otherwise empty)\r\n* Download a stylesheet (e.g., [`css/stylesheet.css`](https://github.com/cranndarach/html-word-template/blob/master/css/stylesheet.css)) and **save it in a subdirectory called `css/` in the same directory where you saved the `.html` file** (that is, the `.html` files link to `css/stylesheet.css`)\r\n\r\n**Then**, you can write in the `.html` file (I'd save it as a new file first) in an editor of your choice, and when you're ready to preview it, open it in a browser.\r\n\r\n### If you're not familiar with HTML and/or CSS:\r\n\r\nI will post a tutorial soon!\r\n",
